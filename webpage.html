        ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker.
        Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose-built
        administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the
        historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United
        Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is the exclusive manufacturer of
        Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003. The BBC called Rolls-Royce
        "probably one of the most recognised icons in the world", and that "the
        name Rolls-Royce entered the English language as a superlative."[3] A
        marketing survey in 1987 showed that only Coca-Cola was a more widely
        known brand than Rolls-Royce.<br />
        Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the
        Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship
        to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced prior to 2003 other than being
        a major engine and other supplier prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors
        Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to
        Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced
        Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each
        company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars
        under the Rolls-Royce brand.<br />
        The Rolls-Royce Phantom four-door saloon was the first product offered
        for sale in 2003. Since then, the company has expanded its product line
        to include extended wheelbase, two-door coupé, and convertible versions
        of the Phantom saloon, as well as the smaller Ghost four-door saloon,
        Wraith two-door coupé, Dawn convertible, the Cullinan SUV, and being
        introduced for 2023, the Spectre, the first all-electric Rolls-Royce.<br>
